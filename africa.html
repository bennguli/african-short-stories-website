            <h2>the lazy township people</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a town where all the people were exceedingly lazy.
 <br>They didn&rsquo;t like to do any kind of work at all! They didn&rsquo;t clean up their yards, they didn&rsquo;t keep their streets clean, and they couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to weed their vegetable patches. The place was disgusting, it was a disgrace <a href="lazy%20township%20people.html">Continue reading </a></p>

        <br> Many hunters lived in his village.
        <br>Some hunters used guns, some used bows and arrows, others used sticks and cutlasses to do their hunting.

        <br> He liked living here. There were lots of other animals to talk to and play with, most of them much smaller than he was, which he particularly liked because it made him feel safe and comfortable at home. The big hunters like the lion hardly ever ventured here because the ground

                  <p>A very long time ago, before man came along to upset the natural balance, all animals lived together peacefully. But in those days, none of the animals had heads of their own, except the elephant, who was the King of the animals. He had a large collection of heads in all shapes and sizes, which he kept stored in a large cave. Every time an animal wished to leave the village compound to go out into the field or the bush, he would go to the elephant first and ask to borrow a head. On his return to the animal village the head would be returned to the king&rsquo;s store. This worked very well for a time. The only problem was that there were not quite enough heads for all the animals. There always seemed to be one short, so at least one of the animals always had to stay behind in the village
